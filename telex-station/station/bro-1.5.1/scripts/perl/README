This follows the same mantra as all other perl installers.


PURPOSE:

  This will install perl modules, libraries, and scripts that are used
  for reports, editing signatures, and other useful utilities.


DEFINITIONS:

  $(PERL) is the path to the perl binary which you wish to use.
  $(INSTALL_ROOT) is this directory which contains the Makefile.PL file.
  BROHOME is the variable found in bro.cfg and defines the start of all
    things Bro. (default: /usr/local/bro)
  BROCONFIG is the location of the bro.cfg file.  (default: 
    /usr/local/bro/etc/bro/cfg)


REQUIREMENTS:

  The minimum version of perl required by this installer and it's libraries
  is 5.6.1 (5.006_001)
  
  The following perl modules are required:
    Socket
    Time::Local
    Config::General (included and will install if neccessary)
    Cwd
    Getopt::Long


INSTALL:

  $(PERL) Makefile.PL (optional args)
  make
  make install


INSTALLER NOTES:

  For those of you maintaining this installer and/or want to include
  additional packages to be installed here's how things are setup.
  
  $(INSTALL_ROOT)/lib contains perl modules (ending in .pm) and will be
  installed in the perl site directory.
  
  $(INSTALL_ROOT)/script contains executable perl scripts which will be
  installed in the directory defined by INSTALLSCRIPT.  The bang paths
  will be automatically changed to the path of the perl binary that was
  used to run Makefile.PL.  Files placed in here will also be scanned
  for the variable $DEFAULT_BRO_CONFIG_FILE.  The value will automatically
  be changed to one of the following in the order listed:
    arguments passed to Makfile.PL:
      BROCONFIG  (this is the path to bro.cfg)
      BROHOME    (this is the path to BROHOME.  etc/bro.cfg will be appended)
    Environment variable:
      $BROHOME   (this is the path to BROHOME.  etc/bro.cfg will be appended)
  
  $(INSTALL_ROOT)/ext contains gzipped perl modules which are included
  as a convenience.  These are packages created by other developers and
  are usually found on cpan.org.  It will be necessary to change Makefile.PL
  if additional packages are placed in here and they need to be installed.
