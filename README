Telex Anticensorship system
---------------------------

Telex is a new approach to resisting network-based censorship, allowing
people access to websites that are blocked by their ISP or government.
Unlike traditional proxies, Telex is deployed in the network, at friendly
ISPs outside of the censor's control. Telex can convert innocuous-looking
connections that pass through these ISPs into connections to an uncensored
proxy server. Because of its position in the network, Telex has no IP
address for censors to block. 

Telex consists of two parts: a Telex station at the friendly ISP, and a 
telex-client that runs on the user's system. We have created a
proof-of-concept implementation, including a small demonstration "ISP"
running the Telex station.

For more information, see our website https://telex.cc

telex-client
--------------------------

The telex client acts as a TCP tunnel for any socket that connects to it.
For our demonstration, we have configured it to tunnel to an HTTP proxy
running on the Telex station.

To build the telex-client from source, see the INSTALL file in the
telex-client directory.


Running telex-client
--------------------------
After installing Telex, run the client binary:

./telex-client notblocked.telex.cc

To use Telex with your browser, change your browser's settings to use an
HTTP(S) proxy of 127.0.0.1 port 8888.


Our public demonstration is limited to a few websites:
    google.com
    telex.cc
    twitter.com
    youtube.com
If you are a researcher requiring access to other sites, please contact us
at telex@umich.edu.
