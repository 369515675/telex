Telex Anticensorship proxy
--------------------------

Telex is a new approach to anticensorship technology, allowing people
access to websites that are blocked by their government. With support from
ISPs around the world, detecting the use of Telex as a proxy is
substantially more difficult than detecting the use of conventional
proxies in use today.

For more information, see our website https://telex.cc
--------------------------

To install and use Telex, see the INSTALL file in the telex-client
directory.

The telex client acts as a TCP tunnel for any socket that connects to it.
The default public key we have included in the telex-client directory
(pubkey) will allow the client to be used as an HTTP proxy, when used with
our demonstration ISP (e.g. NotBlocked.telex.cc).

NOTE:
This software is a proof-of-concept, and does NOT provide strong security.
It is a research prototype only intended to be used for experimental
purposes.
