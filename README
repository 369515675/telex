Telex Anticensorship proxy
--------------------------

Telex is a new approach to anticensorship technology, allowing people
access to websites that are blocked by their government. With support from
ISPs around the world, detecting the use of Telex as a proxy is
substantially more difficult than detecting the use of conventional
proxies in use today.

For more information, see our website https://telex.cc
--------------------------

To install and use Telex, see the INSTALL file in the telex-client
directory.

The telex client acts as a TCP tunnel for any socket that connects to it.
The default public key we have included in the telex-client directory
(pubkey) will allow the client to be used as an HTTP proxy, when used with
our demonstration ISP (e.g. NotBlocked.telex.cc).


RUNNING TELEX
--------------------------
After installing Telex, run the client binary:

./telex_client notblocked.telex.cc

To use Telex with your browser, change your browser's settings to use an
HTTP(S) proxy of 127.0.0.1 port 8888.

Note that we have limitted the Telex proxy access to only a few websites
listed below in order to limit potential abuse:

    google.com
    telex.cc
    twitter.com
    youtube.com

NOTE:
This software is a proof-of-concept, and does NOT provide strong security.
It is a research prototype only intended to be used for experimental
purposes.
