# DESCRIPTION:
# 
# This file is used by the report generator to assign scores to
# certain types of alerts.  Use this file to increase the likelyhood
# that a certain type of alarm is successful.  The scores listed
# in this file will be added to any scores derived by the report
# generator.  The format is -> ALERT_TYPE<white space>SCORE
#
# The score derived by the report generator is influenced by certain
# traffic patterns.  If an alarm is generated and a connection is
# seen coming from the victim host back to the suspect host this will
# drive the score past the $ALARM_THRESHOLD.  Also an alarm generated by
# a host from the internal network will likely produce a score higher
# than the $ALARM_THRESHOLD.  This functionality only affects alarms
# which produce an incident.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# Lets assume you have created a custom alert type of 
# "Employee_Did_Something_Bad".  Lets also assume that this alarm
# is triggered only under certain conditions and you know the alarm is
# always correct or of great interest.  To make this always show up in
# the report set the score to something equal to or higher than the
# $ALARM_THRESHOLD (default: 100).
#
# NOTES:
#
# The only alert type that cannot be given a score is
# "SensitiveSignature".  Instead signatures are given their own
# scores specified in their meta-data. (still in the works)
