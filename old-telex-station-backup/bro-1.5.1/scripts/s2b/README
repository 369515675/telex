# quick README

For the purpose of this readme file it is assumed that Bro is already 
installed and running and you are familiar with the general directory 
structure.

REQUIREMENTS:

	PERL 5.6.1 or greater
	Python


Copy all of the files in the bro-include directory that end in .bro
or .sig to your $BROHOME/policy directory.

If you are running multiple versions of PERL or Python and the required 
version is not running from the default place then you are going to need 
to change the bang path (example: #!/usr/bin/perl) to whatever is appropriate.

All files created by s2b.pl that are used in a running Bro instance will end 
with either .bro or .sig.  The recommended place to put these file is under 
the directory $BROHOME/policy/local as these files can change often and will 
be tuned to a specific site or network traffic type.

Here are example entries to be added to the Bro policy start script so that 
the signature preqrequisites get loaded correctly.

	@load software
	@load signatures
	@load snort
	@load sig-functions.bro
	@load sig-action.bro

On the command line which starts the running Bro process include the 
following.  It is assumed that the frequently updated signatures.sig and 
sig-action.bro are put in the directories $BROHOME/site and 
$BROHOME/policy respectively.  $BRO is the path to the bro binary in use.

	$BRO -s $BROHOME/policy/sig-addendum.sig -s $BROHOME/site/signatures.sig <other command line stuff>


# These are just some quick examples
# Since most of the programs control resides in the --configdir these 
 # commands point to the relative config dir of 'etc/' which is included
 # in the tarball.
# Change to bin/ and try the following commands

# This PERL program requires PERL 5.6.1 minimum and module Config::General
 # which is included in directory pm/ or it can be downloaded from cpan.org

# Create a new s2b-augment.cfg file

./s2b.pl --mainconfig ../etc/s2b.cfg --configdir ../etc --snortrulesetdir ../snort_rules2.2 --updateaugment --augmentconfig ../etc/s2b-augment.cfg


# Create Bro s2b.sig and s2b-siagaction.bro files a remain completely silent outputting no errors if encountered

./s2b.pl --mainconfig ../etc/s2b.cfg --configdir ../etc --snortrulesetdir ../snort_rules2.2 --augmentconfig ../etc/s2b-augment.cfg --debug 0


# Create Bro s2b.sig and s2b-sigaction.bro files and print any errors to STDERR.  (default debug level is 1)

./s2b.pl --mainconfig ../etc/s2b.cfg --configdir ../etc --snortrulesetdir ../snort_rules2.2 --augmentconfig ../etc/s2b-augment.cfg --debug 1


# Show some usage info

./s2b.pl --help


TODO:

   Need to update this readme after the directory structure of Bro has been 
   finalized.
